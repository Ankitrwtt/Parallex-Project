            <p class="text"> Paragliding is an exhilarating adventure sport where individuals soar through the sky using a lightweight, fabric wing. It's a unique way to experience the freedom of flight, propelled by wind currents.

Paragliding offers both thrilling descents and opportunities for long, leisurely flights, allowing for stunning aerial views and a sense of peace and tranquility.

                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

                 <div class="bg" id="bg4"><h2 class="sports">Bungee Jumping</h2></div>
            <p class="text"> Bungee jumping also spelled bungy jumping, is an activity that involves a person jumping from a great height while connected to a large elastic cord. The launching pad is usually erected on a tall structure such as a building or crane, a bridge across a deep ravine, or on a natural geographic feature such as a cliff. It is also possible to jump from a type of aircraft that has the ability to hover above the ground, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter. The thrill comes from the free-falling and the rebound.[1] When the person jumps, the cord stretches and the jumper flies upwards again as the cord recoils, and continues to oscillate up and down until all the kinetic energy is dissipated.

                A tower 1,200 metres (4,000 ft) high with a system to drop a "car" suspended by a cable of "best rubber" was proposed for the Chicago World Fair, 1892â€“1893. The car, seating about two hundred people, would have been shoved from a platform on the tower and then would have bounced to a stop. The designer engineer suggested that for safety the ground below "be covered with eight feet of feather bedding". The proposal was declined by the Fair's organizers.[
